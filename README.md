# httpd.py
The httpd.py project is a web software that was built by python. 

#### Introduce
##### The httpd.py project is a simple and light web server that was built by python. The initial writting purpose is my curiosity about the work flow of web server. That means I want to figure out the web server architecture. To finish it,I have referenced another C language open source project - [tinyhttpd][1].
##### The first goal of this project is built by minimal code line.If you want to learn operating priciple of a static web server and are unwilling to cost lots of time, this project will be your optimal option. You just need to take a few hours to read source code,then you will have more understanding on static web server or http protocol.
#### Environment
##### Operation System: `Windows` or `Linux`
##### Language: `Python 2.7`
#### Install & Run
##### 1. git clone https://github.com/CHENTsang/httpd.py.git
##### 2. cd httpd.py
##### 3. python httpd.py
#### Finally
##### Wish you have a fun!
