# httpd.py
## Introduce
##### The httpd.py project is a simple and light web server that was built by python. The initial writting purpose is my curiosity about the work flow of web server. That means I want to figure out the web server architecture. In order to finish it,I have referenced another C language open source project - <a href = "https://github.com/EZLippi/Tinyhttpd">tinyhttpd</a>.
##### The first goal of this project is built by minimal code line. If you want to learn operating principle of a static web server and are unwilling to spend lots of time, this project will be your optimal option. You just need to take a few hours to read source code, then you will have more understanding on static web server or http protocol.
